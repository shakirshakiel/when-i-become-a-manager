### Behavior 1

- When a new team comes in, always create an aura that they are incompetent and incapable. The new team will try to impress till the point they no longer care about manager's opinion. Just before that point encourage the team. Tell them that they are doing better. Build a bond.
- Once in 2 months show them who is the boss

### Behavior 2

- Get personal and emotional. Tell them your job is at stake because of the team's mistakes. Tell them how you are protecting them.
